# musicBox
Simple music player software for Raspberry Pi in Python

Depends on VLC and SQLite3, designed to be able to scan the UPC barcode from an album cover, then load and play the music files from that album

The files must already exist on local storage, and an entry in the database with the UPC code and the path to the files
